This semester project aims to explore various properties and applications of Martingale theory
and its applications in Financial Mathematics and derivative pricing.
We begin with formal definitions related to probability theory and sigma and sub-sigma algebras.
By exploring the topics related to conditional expectations, filtration and adapted processes, the
project reaches formal definition of Martingales, submartingales and supermartingales. Further
the project details several properties of martingales. The project looks at convergence theorems
related to martingales. The project explores Radon-Nikodym derivatives and the Radon-
Nikodym theorem, which is used later for purpose of pricing derivatives in the latter part of the
project.

\
In the second part of the project, terms and concepts of mathematical finance are introduced.
Concepts such as arbitrage are discussed in detail. The project then looks at Risk-Neutral
Measures and how it relates to our study of martingale measure. We look at several market
models, discrete and continuous and explore the concepts of complete and arbitrage free markets
and conditions pertaining to it. We discuss the ways to price contingent claims. We conclude
the second part of the project by obtaining the Black-Scholes Option pricing formulation using
Risk-Neutral pricing methods.
